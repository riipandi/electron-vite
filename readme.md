# Electron Vite Starter

Starter template for `Electron` + `Vue3` + `Vite2` with TailwindCS integration.
This is based on [electron-vue-vite](https://github.com/caoxiemeihao/electron-vue-vite).

## Quick Start

```
npm run dev
npm run build
```

> In the development environment, we need to transform the 
> Electron related API into commonjs, and you can only use ESM
